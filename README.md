# Family Connection AI Agents

A multi-agent AI system designed to reconnect families, especially between elderly parents and their adult children, using the GenAI AgentOS Protocol and AGNO for specialized LLM agents.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Family disconnection is a growing issue in our modern world. Elderly people often feel isolated, forget important dates, and struggle with daily structure, while their adult children want to stay connected but face barriers of time, logistics, or emotional distance.

## 🚀 Solution

A four-agent AI system that works together to bridge generational gaps:

1. **Memory Agent**: Monitors important dates and provides intelligent analysis
2. **Master Agent**: Coordinates between agents and manages workflow
3. **Elderly Agent**: Friendly, voice-like interface for elderly users
4. **Younger Relative Agent**: Provides insights and suggestions for family connections

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **AGNO**: For specialized LLM agents
- **OpenAI GPT-4o**: For intelligent reasoning and natural language processing
- **GenAI AgentOS Protocol**: For agent-to-agent communication
- **Python**: Core implementation language

### Agent Communication Flow
```
Memory Agent → Master Agent → Elderly Agent
                    ↓
            Younger Relative Agent
```

## 📋 Hackathon Requirements Met

✅ **Multi-Agent Workflow**: 4 specialized agents working together
✅ **GenAI AgentOS Protocol**: Used for agent communication (5 bonus points)
✅ **Complex Task**: Birthday reminder system with emotional intelligence
✅ **Plain Text Input**: System responds to natural language queries
✅ **Unique Capabilities**: Each agent has specialized functions

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd family-connection-agents
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up environment variables**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
```

4. **Run the demo**
```bash
python main.py
```

## 🎬 Demo Scenario

The system demonstrates a birthday reminder workflow:

1. **Memory Agent** checks the `data/birthdays.json` file for birthdays today
2. **Master Agent** receives the alert and coordinates the response
3. **Elderly Agent** generates a warm, personalized birthday reminder
4. **Younger Relative Agent** provides insights and suggestions for staying connected

### Sample Output
```
FAMILY CONNECTION AI AGENTS DEMO
============================================================

Checking for birthdays on January 15, 2025...

Memory Agent: Found 1 birthday(s) today!
Memory Agent: Alerting Master Agent about Sarah's birthday
Master Agent: Received birthday alert for Sarah
Master Agent LLM Response: [Intelligent coordination response]
Elderly Agent: [Warm, personalized birthday reminder]
Elderly Agent: User response: [Realistic elderly user response]
Younger Relative Agent: [Insights and suggestions for family connection]
```
