Hackathon Core Summary & Planning Document
1. Short Summary with Feeling & Vision
This document captures the core insights and vision discussed during the team’s July 12th meeting for the LeadWithAI Hackathon 2025.
The meeting centered around emotional connection, real-world problems of disconnection within families, and how AI can play a gentle, bridging role.
What started as a technical ideation session evolved into a human-centered discussion. We’re creating something to reconnect families—especially between aging parents and their adult children—who often live in emotional or practical disconnection due to time, health, or complexity.
2. Vision, Target Group, Problem & Solution
Vision
We believe disconnection is a growing issue. With the right AI tools, we can foster reconnection—bringing people closer even when life pulls them apart.
Target Group
Primary: Elderly people who feel isolated, forget things, or struggle with daily structure.
Secondary: Their children or younger relatives who want to stay in touch but face barriers of time, logistics or emotional distance.
Problem
- Loneliness
- Lack of reminders and planning assistance
- Disconnection between generations
- Difficulty using modern tech (especially for elders)
- Reduced insight into emotional or medical changes
Solution
A two-agent AI system:
- One agent designed for the elderly user (friendly, voice-activated, memory-assisting)
- One agent for the younger relative (planner, notifier, emotional tracker)
These agents work together to suggest optimal contact moments, remember past conversations, highlight health or emotional signals, and enable storytelling or quizzes that bond generations.
3. What, How, and What to Show
What are we building?
- A multi-agent AI setup
- Voice interaction system
- Planning + memory lane module
- Story mode and quiz triggers based on shared memory/context
- Support for 2-3 person calls
How are we building it?
- Using the GenAI Agents Protocol (required)
- Agents running via simple front-ends or voice interfaces
- Sync with Google Calendar or similar tools for planner
- JSON-style memory or notebook log between agents
- Notion/Google Drive for collaboration
What do we want to show?
- That the agents talk to each other
- That the system learns and adapts
- That it works for real-world scenarios
- That it’s visually, emotionally and structurally simple & relatable
Accessibility Goals
- Voice-first UI for elderly
- Optional visual UIs for younger party
- No mandatory install for elder side
- Easy onboarding & demo-ready workflows
4. Kickoff Checklist
- Finalize name, visuals, and narrative
- Create unified agent prompt logic
- Assign 24h task leads (Day 1: Louis, Day 2: Melissa)
- Connect documentation to the GenAI Challenge criteria
- Use Google Drive to centralize materials
- Ensure demo video narrative is covered (2–4 min goal)
- Create fallback update system (Open Call doc)









1. Memory Agent continuously monitors birthday JSON file
2. When a birthday approaches, Memory Agent alerts Master Agent
3. Master Agent instructs Elderly Agent to remind the user
4. Elderly Agent initiates conversation: "Hey, did you know it's [Name]'s birthday tomorrow?"
5. Elderly Agent can suggest calling or sending a message
6. Younger Relative Agent gets notified of the interaction
